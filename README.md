# SAP Digital Manufacturing Extension Samples
SAP Digital Manufacturing provides an out-of-the-box Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to run production on the shop floor. However, based on the experience gained from customer and partner projects, we also know that a successful MES must have the capability to be extended. With the new releases of Digital Manufacturing Cloud, the options for extensibility have made a significant step forward. Using the sample extensions provided will allow you to learn and understand how to build your own extensions to use with SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud.

## Description
In SAP Digital Manufacturing we distinguish between the following major areas for extensions:

#### Business Process Extensions

#### UI Extensions

Each extension area has a folder in which you can find different sample code according to scenario and to the implementation technology used.

For more information, please check the readme files in the different folders.

## Scenario Overview

| Category      | Scenario      | Overview      | Link          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Business Process Extension | Get Custom Fields from Order Data | In this example we demonstrate how to retrieve order-specific custom data depending on the current material (SFC) that is being worked on. This data can then be passed to external systems to trigger additional processes or to validate that certain conditions are met. | [Get-Custom-Fields-From-Order-Data-Using-SFC](DMC_BusinessProcesses/1-Get-Custom-Fields-From-Order-Data-Using-SFC)  |
UI Extension | Custom Plugin for DMC PODs  | This custom plugin provides the sample implementation of a generic button which can be used in the POD Designer. When the user clicks the button in the POD, a URL will be called and parameters can be passed to the target application. | [Custom-Plugin-for-DMC-PODs](DMC_UX/1-Create-a-Generic-Button-And-Register-As-Custom-PoD-Plugin/CustomPodPlugin)  |

# SAP Manufacturing Execution Extension Samples
SAP Manufacturing Execution (SAP ME) is a powerful, enterprise-level, scalable, manufacturing business solution that enables global manufacturers to manage and control manufacturing and shop floor operations.<br />
With the new release of SAP ME 15.4, all the PAPIs are exposed as REST API’s which enables SAPUI5 based extensions of Production Operator Dashboards (POD) without SAP ME Software Development Kit (SDK).<br />
Using the sample extensions provided will allow you to learn and understand how to build your SAPUI5 based extensions of Production Operator Dashboards to use with SAP ME.
