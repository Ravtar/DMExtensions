# Unit 7 - Side by Side Extensions

## Overview
Side-by-side extensibility enables you to integrate external content within your SAP Customer Experience system by deploying it through APIs, services, applications, events, or development platforms. You can extend existing processes or invent completely new processes while easily combining SAP S/4HANA Cloud data with data from other systems.

## Learning objectives
We allow our customers and partners to develop dependent extensions, develop their own custom applications or consume existing apps. The SAP Business Technology Platform is the accepted choice for building an extension for any SAP cloud solution. The goal is to develop a loosely coupled, but seamlessly integrated extension.
